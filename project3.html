            Our second year module we were given the brief on a group project
            called ‘Moments of Time’, we were to perform this in December 2018
            in the Castle Theatre, Aberystwyth.
          </p>
          <p class="project3p">
            The Brief: Using selected chapters from the text Einstein’s Dreams
            written by Alan Lightman as a provocation, create a short
            scenographic ‘poem’ a design as performance event.
          </p>
          <p class="project3p">
            Our initial concept was to take the idea of running water as a
            timeline through life, at first we thought a waterfall going into
            the river then realised this would not be plausible within the
            Theatre so decided to do a minimalistic design of a river for the
            castle theatre floor that was 12m x 1m. Then the concept was to go
            throughout the eras of music, using small projector to project the
            main thing that happened that decade, an example being, the NHS
            being formed on July 5th, 1948.
          </p>
          <p class="project3p">
            For the performance myself (dressed in a 40s style boiler suit) and
            Zoë (dressed in a 20s style flapper dress) decided we would be like
            ghosts of time, I would sew ping pong balls with dates ranging from
            the 1800s to 2018 on them into the river as well as giving them to
            audience members to throw into the river, distorting projections on
            the water.
