# <u>Milestone Project 1 : User Centric Frontend Development</u> 



For this project I decided to build a portfolio website for my partner. I decided on this idea due to current circumstances making  it increasingly difficult for Sophie to find work, hoping that a new website will help expose what Sophie has to offer to potential employers or customers.



## <u>User Stories</u>

- **First time visitor goals**

  - As a first time visitor, I want to feel welcomed by the style and design of the site
  - As a first time visitor, I want to have an understanding of the sites purpose from the homepage
  - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate around the site

- ## **Returning visitor goals**

  -  As a returning visitor, I want to see if there has been any changes to the site since my last visit
  -  As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily make contact via email or social media
  - As a returning customer I want to feel as though my favourite pages are easily accessible in a clear manor

- **frequent user goals**

  - As a frequent visitor, I want to easily see if there is any new posts or updates
  - As a frequent visitor, I want to be able to access the  site on all my devices regardless of screen size and resolution









## <u>Design</u>

- Colour Scheme

  - â€‹	The main colour scheme used are a dark yellow, black and white to match the hero image

- Typography

  -  The Lobster font is used for titles and headings to make it feel it more personal and the Roboto font was used in the bulk text to assist readability

- 

  - Imagery

  - The hero banner image was designed by Sophie to give her brand an image, the 'featured art works' are a selection of portraits by Sophie, I used one orientation of image to assist consistency  in the page layout.
  - The photographs were taken by Sophie and her peers at university to help them document their projects.
