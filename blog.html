<h3><a href="blog1.html">Come On a Journey With Me</a> </h3>
  <h4>POSTED ON AUGUST 30, 2020</h4>
  
  <p>Well, when I say a journey, I very much mean a mental one, a journey of self growth. This idea of wanting to change my way of thinking has always been at the back of my mind but recently, within the past few days, two things have really wanted me to kickstart a journey of self growth. The first being a youtube video by UnJadedJade called, ‘why we need to uplift women’, her videos have always inspired me and seeing her grow as a person especially over the past year is highly inspiring. This video in particular dives into the idea that the reason we are jealous of other people is because of our own insecurities by what has been ingrained in our brains of what we need from our lives, ie, pretty privilege or the perfect boyfriend.

<h3><a href="blog2.html">My Impossible List</a></h3>
<h4>POSTED ON AUGUST 19, 2020</h4>

<p>The idea of an ‘Impossible list’ has been a thing to me since about 2015 after watching Thomas Franks video who got the idea from Joel Runyon where it is the idea of a more actionable version of a bucket list where you review your goals once they have been completed then further or change them with the appeal of self-improvement and to always have something to achieve. For now, my list is quite short as I splurge my current ideas of what goals I have but over time this should get longer as I strive for more things and complete certain goals. These are somethings I have always wanted to do, although not currently very crazy/wild I’m sure they will get more ambitious over time, for now, this is the result after a 10 min brainstorm of what goals I have. <a href="blog2.html">...Read more</a></p>
