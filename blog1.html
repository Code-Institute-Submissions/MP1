      <h2 class="blogposttitle">Come On a Journey With Me</h2>
      <h3 class="blogposttitle">POSTED ON AUGUST 30, 2020</h3>
      <p> Well, when I say a journey, I very much mean a mental one, a journey of
        self growth. This idea of wanting to change my way of thinking has always
        been at the back of my mind but recently, within the past few days, two
        things have really wanted me to kickstart a journey of self growth. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The first being a youtube video by UnJadedJade called,<a href="https://youtu.be/jSC0IrhsKxY"> ‘why we need to uplift
        women’</a>, her videos have always inspired me and seeing her grow as a person
        especially over the past year is highly inspiring. This video in
        particular dives into the idea that the reason we are jealous of other
        people is because of our own insecurities by what has been ingrained in
        our brains of what we need from our lives, ie, pretty privilege or the
        perfect boyfriend.
      </p>
      <p>
        A question I now ask myself is ‘why am I jealous of
        this person?’ and to realise it can be down to something I feel I
        personally do not have. The second that made me realise I want to change
        my way of thinking was a poem written by a dear friend, Shannon Pendleton,
        called ‘Some Days’, <a href="https://thehysteriacollective.com/2020/08/25/titbits-the-nuances-of-my-body-somedays/">click here to read her beautiful poem.</a> The poem goes
        into body image and wishing to be different but learning to love yourself
        through love. I highly suggest giving it a read, as I believe we all go on
        a journey of loving and hating our body, I would like to think over the
        next year or so I can truly say I love my body for what it is, which
        recently has been a huge struggle.
      </p>
      <p>Over this next ongoing journey I would
        love to be more sustainable in all aspects of my life, feel more confident
        in myself and my abilities and overall, be a better person. To reflect on
        my journey over time, I will be journaling every day in my bullet journal
        of prompts that I have made myself, if you so wish so come on this journey
        with me then feel free to use the prompts below. Although, do not feel
        like you need a bullet journal or notebook, I have found my notes page on
        my phone or laptop are just as good when I am on the go!
