      <h4 class="blogposttitle">POSTED ON AUGUST 30, 2020</h4>

      <p>
        Well, when I say a journey, I very much mean a mental one, a journey of
        self growth. This idea of wanting to change my way of thinking has
        always been at the back of my mind but recently, within the past few
        days, two things have really wanted me to kickstart a journey of self
        growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first being a youtube video by UnJadedJade called,
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSC0IrhsKxY&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=UnJadedJade"
          target="_blank"
        >
          ‘why we need to uplift women’,</a
        >
        her videos have always inspired me and seeing her grow as a person
        especially over the past year is highly inspiring. This video in
        particular dives into the idea that the reason we are jealous of other
        people is because of our own insecurities by what has been ingrained in
        our brains of what we need from our lives, ie, pretty privilege or the
        perfect boyfriend. A question I now ask myself is ‘why am I jealous of
        this person?’ and to realise it can be down to something I feel I
        personally do not have. The second that made me realise I want to change
        my way of thinking was a poem written by a dear friend, Shannon
        Pendleton, called ‘Some Days’,
        <a
          href="https://thehysteriacollective.com/2020/08/25/titbits-the-nuances-of-my-body-somedays/"
          target="_blank"
        >
          click here to read her beautiful poem.</a
        >
        The poem goes into body image and wishing to be different but learning
        to love yourself through love. I highly suggest giving it a read, as I
        believe we all go on a journey of loving and hating our body, I would
        like to think over the next year or so I can truly say I love my body
        for what it is, which recently has been a huge struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over this next ongoing journey I would love to be more sustainable in
        all aspects of my life, feel more confident in myself and my abilities
        and overall, be a better person. To reflect on my journey over time, I
        will be journaling every day in my bullet journal of prompts that I have
        made myself, if you so wish so come on this journey with me then feel
        free to use the prompts below. Although, do not feel like you need a
        bullet journal or notebook, I have found my notes page on my phone or
        laptop are just as good when I am on the go! I will be spending Monday
        August 31st setting out my goals for the next month, quarter and year
        ready to start day one on Tuesday. I most likely will not be sharing my
        answers on here unless I feel like it can kickstart a conversation etc
        as obviously they can be quite personal questions, but nonetheless, I
        hope you enjoy the prompts I have set out for you and my aim is to keep
        them up each month for the foreseeable future for myself so I shall
        share them with you too. If you do wish to come on this self love
        journey with me, feel free to message me and we can chat regularly,
        share some positivity and stay motivated.
