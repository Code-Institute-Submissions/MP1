            For the past two years, I have partaken in the performance The Vagina
            Monologues by Eve Ensler in Aberystwyth. After interviewing 200
            women she brought together The Vagina Monologues and 24 years later
            it has been a popular choice to perform in February and March
            alongside This Girl Can Week and International Women’s Day (March
            8th).
          </p>
          <p class="project2p">
            This year we were raising money for Welsh Women’s Aid and to raise
            awareness about domestic violence- their website can be found here
            if you would like some more information on the charity and their
            services or would like to get involved:
            <a href="https://www.westwalesdas.org.uk/" target="_blank"

          </p>
          <p class="project2p">
            The monologues I performed were, The Coochie Snorcher That Could and
            I Was There In The Room. Both of these monologues were very
            emotional, much like the rest of the play, which gives you a
            connection with the audience. I also was the assistant director
            alongside Lowri Morgan and helped bring the play together and the
            group bond as one. It seems weird talking about the vagina in an
            everyday context as there is such a stigma surrounding it, which is
            in such a parallel to the male genitalia which seems to strike
            conversation quite easily (although it is not usually about serious
            issues, you do not usually hear jokes about the vagina).
          </p>
          <p class="project2p">
            This got me thinking about all the stigmatised conversations we try
            and at most fail to have with topics such as periods, sex and
            even cancer that was brought up during the performance. This play
            has also got me thinking about what being a woman means to me,
            although I think this should be a stand-alone blog post.
          </p>
          <p class="project2p">
            After each performance, I spoke to different audience members and
            tried to scope their reactions to the performance, although you can
            see people’s faces when you say certain lines that can be quite
            horrifying as well as the smiles on their faces on the funny parts
            of the play- it really takes you through an emotional rollercoaster.
          </p>
          <p class="project2p">
            People, especially men who came to see the performance, were not as
            aware of the different nicknames we grow up with instead of the
            word “vagina”, some of my favourites were, ‘a twat’, ‘front bottom’
            and ‘tuppence’, the last two being part of the five words you can
            add in to make the performance more localised, but these are what I
            grew up with.
          </p>
          <p class="project2p">
            People were shocked at the list of nearly 100 words of what we call
            our vaginas, whereas others, shared their own experiences of the
            names they grew up with! The female empowerment I felt from this
            performance, both times of performing it, was insane! I have made
            some friends with people I would never have met otherwise and just
            sharing our experiences as women together made me feel less alone in
            how I feel. These women are wonderful people and I am very thankful
            to share the experience of this show with them. Thank you very much
            to all the lovely people involved in the show and to those who came
            to see it, we loved every minute of it!
